1) Get the code:

	 git clone git://github.com/maluta/visualportageconfig.git
	 cd visualportageconfig

2) Compile:

	 qmake -project
	 qmake
	 make 

3) Make a copy of make.conf to tests (this are setted on constants.h)

	 cp /etc/make.conf /tmp
 
4) Run

	./visualportageconfig

5) Report bugs and ask for features :-)

	As you can see it's a simple interface, I'd like to know
	from other Gentoo users what can be improved and the bugs.

	You can add an Issue or send me an email
	tiago.maluta 'at' gmail.com
